Hi there!
I'm Nikhil.

I'm a student at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani currently in my final year of study. Though I'm pursuing my bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I have varied interests, mostly apart from my major.

I'm currently trying to make sense of my life, building the blocks for the future perhaps, so you'll find me engaged in altogether different sorts of stuff like building projects, exploring a new framework, busy debugging stuff to perfection (_read: my way_) reading on different subjects, learning some MOOCs, and sometimes going to classes as well.

You would find me by the alias _nikhilweee_ on all major social platforms. Feel free to get in touch.
