Hi there!
I'm Nikhil.

I'm a graduate from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani who is currently working on finding ways to make machines talk in a more natural manner. Apart from work, you can find me travelling, reading, or sometimes just chilling out at home as well ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .

You would find me by the alias _nikhilweee_ on all major social platforms. Feel free to get in touch!
