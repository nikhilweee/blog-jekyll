Lately I've come across many headlines talking about this new site [sarahah.com](https://sarahah.com) and how it's spreading like fire all around. What was this site all about? I myself didn't bother to check it out until my wall was full of people posting their sarahah links.

So I finally decided to give it a shot. _(No, I still havent given it. It used a dummy account.)_

Well, as it turns out the site is pretty simple. All you have to do is register for an account to get your own personalised link, which you can spread across to get feedback from your followers.

Why was this getting popular? Well, that's a whole another topic of discussion, but the concept looks fairly easy. Why not build a tutorial? 


Recently my wall was full of people sharing their sarahah links. I didn't know what it was.

The internet is full of people sharing links from sarahah.com. Well, the app itself seems simple enough, so I thought why not teach aspiring developers to build their own version of sarahah, learning the web along the way?

Well, _sarahah_ is arabic for _honesty_, so I decided to name the app _Honestly_ following the analogy.
